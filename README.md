## Futbol tournament web
In this project, I am going to create a web page in Angular about futbol tournament with personalized team pages, leaderboards, upcoming matches and other features.

For this, I will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AngularJS framework, and non-relational database MongoDB.

The purpose of this project is to use new tools and functionalities of Angular that I did not know. In this way, I intend to increase my skills with the framework.
